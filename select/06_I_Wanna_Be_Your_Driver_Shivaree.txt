Wanna be your driver, wanna be your driver
I'd love to ride you, love to ride you around
We'll be ready when you want me to
Drive you on downtown

I wanna drive your, your long and beautiful
Your rounded body, wheel-to-roll limousine
I've never had the thrill of riding
Such a wonderful machine

Roll around the mountain, down in the valley
Drive you all over, ride you home with ease
You will enjoy every journey
It will be my aim to please

Let me be your driver, let me be your driver
I'd love to ride you, love to ride you downtown
Drive you so slow and easy
You won't wanna put me down
