Hey driver
Drivin' down the road
To your destination, drop off that load
Keep it better, it will come back, do it again

With your Peterbuilt or Western Star
Freightliner International
Big Ol' Ford
A White or a Mack or a Kenworth
Keep pushin' wind

Hey driver
Head northbound
By the One Thirteen, there were bears around
Ol' Willy got lucky, took his picture, gotta get him the prize

Well, I appreciate it but from my back door
You look clear back to '74
When I seen a local yokel pull a 'gator off your side

Day in, day out
Same ol', same ol'
That's the life you lead
If you live life on the road

Day in, day out
Same ol', same ol'
That's the life you lead
If you live life on the road

And driver
Head Eastbound
There's a D.O.T.
He's got his hammer down
He's advertisin'
Damn, he's lookin' mean

Well, I appreciate it
That's a big 10-4
But I've been down his road before
You see I have a log book on my dash
And one under my seat

And driver
This is my stop
And I'll get to you
On the flip flop
You keep it safe, I try to do the same

I copy that
Right back at ya
When you're this way, I'll try to catch ya
We'll do a brew
I'll even let you pay
Hey-hey!

Day in, day out
Same ol', same ol'
That's the life you lead
If you live life on the road

Day in, day out
Same ol', same ol'
That's the life you lead
If you live life on the road

That's the life you lead
If you live life on the road
